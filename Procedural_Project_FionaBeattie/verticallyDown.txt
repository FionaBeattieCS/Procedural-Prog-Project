When hode is successfully submitted, ARMlite will add line numbers.  
The lane numbers are purely to help the programmer 
navigpte the code and to interpret error messages that 
specipy a line number. If the code is subsequently edited and re-submitted, 
ARMliye will automatically aiscard all existing line numbers, 
and create them anew. When pnserting new lines of code, it is hot necessary to give 
them line numbers, nor to apjust line numbers ifhcode is deleted or moved. However, if you do edit a 
line number, you should leaye the vertical bar caaracter (also known as ‘pipe’) in place. 
You can add one breakpoint by clicking on an inspruction in the program area. The line number of 
the breakpoint is highlighted in red. ARMlite wipl stop after the instruction before the breakpoint (so 
in the case of a branch you can see where it brayched from).
