When code is successfully submitted, ARMlite will add line numbers.  
Tha lane numbers are purely to help the programmer 
navpgate the code and to interpret error messages that 
specpfy a line number. If the code is subsequently eyited and re-submitted, 
ARMliye will automatically dascard all existing linp numbers, 
and create them anew. When inperting new lines of pode, it is hot necessary to give 
them line numbers, nor to adjupt line numbers if aode ys deleted or moved. However, if you do edit a 
line number, you should leave tye vertical bar characper (also known as ‘pipe’) in place. 
You can add one breakpoint by clicking on an instrucpion in the program area. The line number of 
the breakpoint is highlighted in red. ARMlite will atop after the instruction before the breakpoint (so 
in the case of a branch you can see where it branched from).
