# Procedural-Prog-Project
Project Title: Procedural Programming Java Project

Project Description:
This Java project, completed as part of my Year 1 coursework at Queen's University Belfast, demonstrates my proficiency in procedural programming. The project consists of three parts, each designed to showcase different aspects of my programming skills.

Part 1 - Text Analysis (40 Marks):
Part 1 focuses on text analysis and the creation of various methods. These methods include checking if a character is a letter, comparing letters while ignoring case, finding the longest word in a text, counting different letters, and determining the most common letter in a given text.

Part 2 - Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption (30 Marks):
Part 2 introduces the concept of a Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption technique. The project includes methods for both encrypting and decrypting text using a user-defined shift value. This shift value determines how the text is transformed, maintaining the case of letters and leaving other characters unchanged.

Part 3 - Searching for "Wally" (30 Marks):
Part 3 involves searching for occurrences of the word "Wally" in text but with a twist: it searches both vertically and diagonally. The speed of execution in various scenarios is assessed, making it a challenging but rewarding task.

Project Details:
Created using the Java programming language.
Developed in Eclipse IDE, as required for the project.
Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3 are separate components that can be explored individually.
Documentation and Code Comments:
The project includes comprehensive Javadoc comments at the beginning of each method, enhancing code readability and understanding. Additionally, there are in-code comments to explain complex logic and improve marker comprehension.

Test Cases:
Test cases for each method ensure that the project's logic and functionality are sound.

Scalable Usage:
This project serves as an excellent example of my problem-solving, coding, and documentation skills. The flexibility of the code allows for future expansion and adaptation for various text analysis and transformation tasks.
